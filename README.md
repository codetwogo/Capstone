3) Make a PR that references that issue
4) Get it code reviewed by someone on the team, address any comments
5) Merge into dev-master - This will include all comments -  Recap during Night Debrief

Code style guide

- Pay attention to the linter!
- Use semicolons
- Use Tabs
- Trailing commas where possible
- const or let over var
- Use require and module.exports in .js files
- Use import and export in .jsx files, unless require makes for cleaner code
- Put import statements at top
- Put the default export at bottom
- Consider splitting up any file larger than 100 lines
- Define container components and presentational components in separate files
- Use the "ducks" pattern for redux
- Name files using lowercase-and-dashes instead of camelCase or PascalCase, except for when the default export is a class, then use PascalCase
- Define react components as pure functions (instead of classes) whenever possible
